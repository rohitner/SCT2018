#### To run:-

`cd` into `frontend/` and run `yarn start` to start the development server
`yarn build` to bundle the static files

And in another terminal, run `python3 backend/app.py`

#### Android App

You need to install expo on your android device. `cd` into `android` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies in `node_module`. Then run `react-native run-android` to run the project on expo via a QR code or through connecting the device to the system. When in doubt, refer the docs. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html
